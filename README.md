In order to ensure my program was functional and secure, I checked the coverage and confirmed it was over 90%. Testing as many lines as possible helped me find problems and eliminate them. I kept most variables private to keep them inside their class, a standard security measure. I checked the requirements for the course and ensured my testing followed those guidelines. To interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program, I first read what was expected in the program. I then broke those needs into smaller increments to make it easier to implement and test. For example, I ensured that the 10-character limit was implemented and then made a test for it. Then, I would change the string to 11 characters and test expecting an error. If I got the error, I knew my tests were working. I approach designing by first understanding the requirements involved. Then, I look for existing systems that match some of the criteria to analyze. I also like to create a diagram to get a sense of my program's flow and ensure all requirements are considered. I have realized that testing the program often helps find errors differently than just error testing when completed. Making multiple passes at the end of building the program allows the code be up to standard practices for others to read.
